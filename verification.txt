# Test powered sensor

Connect a DS18B20 temperature sensor to a Photon on a breadboard.
Connect pin 1 to D3, pin 2 to D4, pin 3 to D5, 10 k ohm resistor between pin 2 and 3.
Flash DS18x20_Temperature.ino example.
Open serial conenction and check that the temperature is read.

Repeat for Core and Electron

# Test parasitic sensor

Connect a DS18B20-PAR temperature sensor to a Photon on a breadboard.
Connect pin 1 to GND, pin 2 to D4, pin 3 to VIN, 1.5 k ohm resistor between pin 2 and VIN.
Flash DS18x20_Temperature.ino example.
Open serial conenction and check that the temperature is read.

Repeat for Core and Electron
